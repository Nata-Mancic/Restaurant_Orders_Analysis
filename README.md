# Restaurant Orders Analysis

This is a project related to a fictional Taste of the World Café,
a restaurant that has diverse menu offerings and serves generous portions. 
The Taste of the World Café debuted a new menu at the start of the year.

The key to the analysis is to dig into the customer data to see which of the
menu items are doing well and what the top customers like the most. 

## Dataset
A quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine,
including the date and time of each order, the items ordered, and additional details on the type, name and price of the items.

There are two tables in the database:
* Restaurant Sales Menu Items
* Restaurant Sales Order Details

**Note**: project idea and data are taken from the Maven Analytics website.

## Tools
* **Data analysis**: PostgreSQL
* **Data visualization**: Tableau

## Goal
We need to answer to the following questions in order to determine which of the items from the new menu are doing well:
* What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
* What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?
* Were there certain times that had more or less orders?
* Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?
